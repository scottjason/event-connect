**Description**

Grabs geolocation and populates the up and coming music events in the users area. Renders dates, times, venues, artist images and bios.

The user can choose to search by artist for all events.

In an effort to provide information to the artist about where they're wanted most, the user can make a request to the artist's "Artist Wanted Wall". In addition to providing market awareness, the user can leave small notes to the artist along with their request and follow the wall itself.
