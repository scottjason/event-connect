Live Site Hosted By Modulus.io: [event.connect](http://eventconnect-22267.onmodulus.net/)

**Description**

Auto-collects geolocation on client-connect and populates the up and coming music events in the users area. Renders dates, times, venues, artist images and bios using the LastFM API on the server.

In an effort to provide information to the artist about where they're wanted most, the user can make a request to the artist's "Artist Wanted Wall". 

In addition to providing market awareness, the user can leave small notes to the artist along with their request and follow the wall itself. This data is stored to and pulled from MongoDB.

Additionaly, the user can choose to search events by artist as well as request their top tracks.
